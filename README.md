#Problem Statement : 
->As students ourselves we know the challenges faced by our peers in day-to-day life   .. so we would like to build a platform so that students can share their thoughts, work, and their life experiences .. and the targeted audience will be the students of KIIT university. We decided on this as our theme because there are not many ways for the students of KIIT to communicate with each other, and with such a large population .. this gets worse. This platform will provide students to connect and share their ideas, and help them to form their communities and work together on projects.
